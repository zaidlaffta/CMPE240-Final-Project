PUF implementation and testing using Nand Flash
This is a description of the use of physical unclonable functions or what known as (PUFs) implemented using NAND flash on a community devices using COTS chip. But first this paper will talk about PUF and define it well for the end reader to help have a holistic picture of PUF before start implementing it on the NAND flash Memory. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are innovative primitives to extract secret keys from the unique submicron structure of integrated circuits. PUFs avoid storing the secret key in the nonvolatile memory directly, providing interesting advantages such as physical unclonability and tamper resistance. The reason behind this implementation is to motivates the use of PUFs versus conventional secure nonvolatile memories that cost more and sometime easier to hack. There are other subjects that will be discussed in the paper within the same top like Error-Correcting Codes (ECC), Flash Physical Unclonable Function( NFPUF), and bit mapping just to name a few.
